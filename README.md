# Stock Sentiment Analysis with Historical Price Correlation

This project explores the relationship between news sentiment and stock prices using a combination of data wrangling, feature engineering, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning modeling. The main goal is to extract financial news, perform sentiment analysis, and correlate it with historical stock price movements to predict trends or understand market behavior.
